# Title : Privacy seeking effects

## Abstract :
The goal of the paper was to show the existence of a chilling effect using the Wikipedia pageviews of articles from a list of Terrorism related articles. On the other hand, we propose to study the effect on the will of seeking privacy enhancing technologies, through what we hope would be an increase in the pageviews of privacy related articles. In order to prove it, we construct a curated list of articles which can correspond to the concept of privacy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Internet_privacy), and then provide an analysis using segmented regression (+ other methods we see fit) to examine the effect the PRISM reveal has on the search for privacy. We may also want to identify other instances in time where we see changes in the trend on pageviews for privacy-related articles.

## 1. Research questions:  
- Can we identify a change of trend in pageviews for privacy-related articles after the PRISM surveillance reveal ? (exogenous + long term).
- Do we observe other time instances of sudden changes in pageviews for privacy related articles ?
- Compare the effect of different events + enlarge the search to more countries (e.g., French Wikipedia, etc.)

## 2. Proposed dataset:
As our dataset, we will fetch pageviews for curated list of articles. To this end, we consider the following list of Wikipedia privacy-related articles:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_laws_of_the_United_States

## 3. Methods
We would like to follow similar approach as used in the paper to explore if there is significant change in pageviews of privacy-related articles. We use interrupted time series (ITS) design will of seeking privacy enhancing technologies. In addition, we would explore long term effect of the event.

## 4. Proposed Timeline
- Fetching the data (2 person hours)
- Segmented regression for the PRISM dataset (2 person hours)
- Identifying more changes in pageviews (3 person hours)
- Enlarging scope to Wikipedia articles of different languages (5 person hours)
- Comparing effects of other events (5 person hours)
- Prepare an extension data story (3 person hours)

## 5. Organization with the team:

## 6. Questions for TAs :
Is this project complex enough to justify doing it as a group of 3 ?
